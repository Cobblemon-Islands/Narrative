**Continuing off of Fiocco's proposal for the background and development of Steel City, the following depicts potential Player to NPC dialogue, along with my notes behind the reasoning for each. Please note that every open and closed quotation depicts one text box. WIP!**

- Big Corp Representative [**Iolana**] (ai-oh-LA-na)
- Engaging and friendly woman at the peak of her career. With a degree in marketing and a strong drive, she works to promote her company's initiatives.

	Iolana
		"Hey hey! Where are you off to in such a rush?"
	Player
		"Oh, uh actually I was just visiting-"
	Iolana
		"Perfect! I assume you've heard ALL about [Big Corp] then? I can't remember the last visitor who didn't come to see what we're working on next!"
	Player
		"[Big Corp]?"
	Iolana
		"...[Big Corp]? Oh my, you must REALLY be from out of town! Well since you so humbly asked for an explanation, allow me to enlighten you! Believe it or not, you've already seen our work. Everything from the boat you rode in on down to the beautiful building design all around you, [Big Corp]!"
		"Hao'nui, the city of progress and steel, you've at least heard of that saying right?"
	Player
		"I think that was on the boat."
	Iolana
		"So it was! Well [Big Corp] helped make that saying into a REALITY! It didn't just pop up out of nowhere. Say, you look pretty well off, did you know our investors' benefits are also listed on that same boat? I could get you set up right away!"
	Player
		"I think I'll have a...look around first."
	Iolana
		"Suit yourself! Be sure to check out [Big Corp] Stadium, it really is a beautiful center piece to our lovely work. Maybe it'll change your mind!"
	Player
		"Right."
	Iolana
		"I'll be here! Oh and if you see Johnny be sure to tell him his water bill is overdue."
	Player
		"...Right!"
