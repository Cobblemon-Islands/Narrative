## The Birth of Hao'nui Book
A long time ago, Hao'nui wasn't the lush and modern city that is now known across all of Lo'ai Isles. Instead, it was known by another name, now lost to time, just as many of the traditions that once gave this beautiful island its identity have been lost.

The journey that transformed it from a humble village of iron merchants to the shining jewel of the entire archipelago was nothing short of a miracle. It was a story forged through the collaboration and deep friendship between the islanders and the generous members of Aegis Inc., who, in our darkest hour, rushed to our aid during a terrifying epidemic of poke-madness that ravaged us in those years. The hope and unity that emerged from this unexpected alliance became our salvation, and together, we rebuilt not just our homes, but our very future.

One autumn day, a sense of unease spread through the village as some of the inhabitants suddenly began to experience fits of poke-madness, unable to continue their work. It all began when a mysterious metal Pokémon appeared in the excavation area. Its gleaming, unnatural body and dense, unsettling texture seemed to warp the air around it. The Pokémon caused intense irritation to the skin and left lingering, painful damage upon contact. As the days passed, the initial outbreak spiraled into a full-blown epidemic, and soon more and more workers lost their grip on reality. Desperation set in as the village watched their people crumble. [1]

Aegis Inc. already in contact with the [previous kahuna] of Maemae at the time, proposed a pact with her. It was a deal of mutual collaboration, economic support, and access to cutting-edge technologies, in exchange for land concessions and rights to the island's resources. The [previous kahuna] of that time had to make the difficult decision to seal the deal.

The contaminated area was cleared, and from there, the work began to introduce complex and sophisticated new machinery. It was a relentless, explosive evolution for the island. Everything was industrialized, every corner was rethought and reshaped. The manager of the time put forward the proposal to rename the village to Hao'nui, and the majority voted for a future of progress and prosperity. Today, the [kahuna] still maintains close contact with the company’s leaders, working together to design a future that holds a new era for the island.

## How to Mana Festival Book

The director was thrilled at the idea of hosting the new edition of the festival! From the central square, we’ll have access to the entire Hao'nui stadium for the first time! Like a Wailmer evolving into a Wailord as I say. Those artificial lights shine brighter than a sea of Lanturn on a moonless night. Oh my Gorebyss technology is amazing, but also a little intimidating at the same time heheh. [5]

Anyway, let’s talk about the script because when it comes to making things pretty, no one does it better than me! :)

Ok so in the intro, my Staryu will spray his Water Guns creating the coolest drizzle over the dancers, while the spotlights will take the place of Lanturn, shining directly onto the streams of water. In our tests, this created a beautiful rainbow over the dancers’ performance. Oh wait, we haven’t tested it yet? For Gyarados’s sake, we need to rethink everything aaaaah!

## Author's Notes
- [1] inspired by killers of the flower moon here ngl
- [2] I'd want some indirect narrative and like a loooot of foreshadowing involved here, implying Aegis may or may not have caused the 'mysterious metal pokemon' epidemic. The player needs to reach the information that Aegis used modified Meltans/Melmetals with mercury to get a hold on to Hao'nui through multiple quests and dialogue
- [3] factor 27 = cobalt,  poisonous and cause of breathing difficulties
- [4] factor 80 = mercury, highly poisonous and causes damage to the nerve system
- [5] player will recognize this book is written by [kahuna] by recognizing all the references to water type mons, I'd like that to be part of her personality, also she doesnt have to be act like a kahuna from the games but more like a village chief
- [6] if this is too dark we can keep it for ourselves as material picturing the real colors of Aegis Inc.
