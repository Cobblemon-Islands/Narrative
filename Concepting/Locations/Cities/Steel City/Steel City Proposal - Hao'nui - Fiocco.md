## Foundation
Originally known as the precious city due to the fair amount of rare mineral deposits scattered across the land, this village has always found a way to establish itself among the wealthiest islands of the Lo'ai Isles. The first locals who arrived on the island, noticing the abundance of ferrous veins, started a collaboration with the local Rock-type pokemons to facilitate the gathering operation. These high-value materials were then traded with neighboring islands, creating a stable and lasting economy. The original inhabitants of Maemae Village used to show their gratitude to the pokemons for their manual assistance by dedicating songs and traditional dances to them, such as the famous Mana Hula (hula meaning "dance") still performed to this day during the Mana Festival.

In particular Excadrills, Geodudes, and Mawiles are historically tied to the tradition of the old village as they were hired by the first inhabitants for excavation work in exchange for berries and apricorns, when Poké Balls were not yet a widespread invention. The Pokémons worked in harmony with humans under the scorching sun of the Lo'ai Isles, creating a strong bond of mutual complicity between the two, destined to transcend centuries. The very same Pokémons species continue their work with the inhabitants to this day.

Over the course of years and with the dawn of the new industrial era, some investors from the recently established Aegis Inc. manifested their interests on the mining potential of the quarries in Maemae Village, hoping for a prosperous future in collaboration with the locals. However, the wise head of the vilalge strongly rejected the offers from Aegis Inc., deeming them too presumptuous and alien to the true needs of his beloved people at the time.

Nonetheless, the influence of Aegis Inc. grew, leading to the rapid and radical industrialization of the village. Shimmering buildings loomed over the  huts of Maemae Village's inhabitants, while new roads and infrastructure were rapidly taking shape before their eyes. Around this time the village was soon renamed into Hao'nui, the city of progress and steel. While some of the inhabitants fully embraced the technology as new resources were brought in, another group chose to join the haven, continuing to preserve the original traditions of Maemae Village through Alani and their followers, peacefully coexisting with the industry. Or so it seems.
