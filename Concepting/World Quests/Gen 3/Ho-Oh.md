Concepts for Ho-Oh. Referencing slightly off the ideas already formed in Quest Ideas. 

Environment Concepts: Optional
A specific island is made for Ho-Oh’s spawn. Snow capped mountains. Trees surround the base of the mountains as well as around the tower and shrine. Worn cobble paths leading from around the shrine, to the tower. Perhaps worn and aged statues are placed around the island.  

Key Item: Rainbow Wing  
Appearance Idea: Maybe it could have a sparkling effect on it like a shiny Pokemon would. Same idea applies for the Silver Wing

  
Rainbow Wing Description A mystic feather of rainbow colors and soft sparkles. It’s warm within your hand.  

Quest 1 Focus: 3 Legendary Beasts  
Questline Name: Reborn from Ashes

Trigger Event:  
Idea 1: Triggers upon the players obtaining Entei, Raikou, Suicune. This now catches the player’s interest and engages them to continue the questline to find Ho-Oh.  
  
Idea 2: Triggers upon the player obtaining a book containing the legend/tale of Ho-Oh and the 3 Beasts. Gives the players motivation to collect all 3 in order to encounter Ho-Oh.

Additional Steps for Quest 1  
  
Going off the already present idea of 3 items of the legendary beasts, this could add an extra step to deter players that already have the 3 from instantly completing the questline. Engaging the player is preferable for questlines. A lot of players might already have the 3 beasts.  
  
Additional concept: Player has the 3 beasts and is ready to advance through the tower. But wait! The player needs to find 3 additional items to place within the shrine located not far from the tower. Within the shrine sits a pedestal with 3 empty slots. Carved under the slots are 3 symbols. Fire. Lightning. Ice.  
  
Item Idea 1: Small, wood-carved totems of Entei, Raikou, and Suicune.  
Item Idea 2: Unique stones resembling the 3 beasts. More challenging for the player to guess its purpose.  
  
Totem Description: “A small totem carved out of wood. It seems to resemble Beast Name”  
Stone Description: ”A small, pretty (Red/Yellow/Blue stone.) It reminds you of…Beast Name Optional OR “Raging fire.” “Fierce lightning.” “Resilient rivers” (Can be something else)
Acquiring the Items: ? (Should have a random chance spawn rate)

  
Items are to be placed upon the shrine pedestal in each specific space, perhaps unlocking the Rainbow Wing.  
  

  
Quest 2 Focus: Climb the Tower  
Questline Name: (Rainbow Trails)

  
Trigger Event: Player has obtained the Rainbow Wing, giving them access to the tower.  
  
Step 1. Player must have the Rainbow Wing present within inventory to enter the tower and progress the floors.  
  
Step 2: Player must reach the 4th floor to encounter Ho-Oh.  
  
Step 3: Using/Discarding the Rainbow Wing.  
Idea: Could be placed upon a pedestal within the room Ho-Oh resides, spawning it in.  
Idea: Placing the Rainbow Wing upon  the pedestal spawns a portal which spawns the player before Ho-Oh.  
  
  
Item Usage(?): “The feather glows warm within your hand, shimmering bright. You place it upon the pedestal, the vibrant rainbow filling the room.”  
  
Portal opens and Ho-Oh is now available to engage.  
  
  

  
Optional Content:  
  
Book containing the legend of Ho-Oh and the 3 Beasts. Helps newer players perhaps.  
Obtained: ?  
  
Book Description: “A worn but sturdy book containing the legend of a beautiful Pokemon and 3 beasts.”  
  
  

Book Contents (Player is reading paragraphs that interest them most.)
  

Paragraph 1: “Long ago a tower resided and perched upon it, a beautiful bird of many colors. The sight of this very Pokemon granted eternal happiness to those blessed with its presence.

Descending from the skies, only those with the purest of hearts were to lay eyes upon its beauty…”

  

Paragraph 2: “...However, tragedy struck and the tower was burnt to the ground with a strike of fierce lightning, taking the lives of 3 Pokemon within. As the sun peaked from the horizon, from the sky descended the mystical bird, rainbow trails left in its wake. With a mighty cry and a flap of its wings, 3 beasts of legend were reborn from the ashes to roam the land once more, all disappearing to not be seen again.”

  

A different slip of paper falls from the pages (Via using the book?) It seems to be notes written down by someone unknown.”

  

“3 must be found and gathered. Only then will the rainbow reveal itself.”

“Fire.” “Lightning” Water.”

  
Simple enough to hint at the 3 beasts and interest the player.
