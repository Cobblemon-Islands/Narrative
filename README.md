# Narrative
Narrative and worldbuilding for the Lo'ai region!

All planning, design and concepting documents go in the [[Concepting]] folder - these don't have to be the _cleanest_ things ever. Any documents outside of that MUST be signed off by either the Narrative Lead or the Direction Lead (ideally both depending on project)


### Current Narrative Team:
- Amo
